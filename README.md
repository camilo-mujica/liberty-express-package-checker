# Liberty Express Package Delivery Status Checker

This is a Node.js application that checks the status of a series of package deliveries from Liberty Express (https://libertyexpress.com/es-ve/). It utilizes Puppeteer for web scraping and email notifications to alert you when there are changes in the package statuses.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/camilo-mujica/liberty-express-package-checker.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd liberty-express-package-checker
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

   - TIMER: Timer in milliseconds
   - PACKAGES: Tracking numbers, a comma-separated list of tracking numbers
   - RECIPIENT_EMAILS: Email address to send notifications to, a comma-separated list of email addresses
   - EMAIL_FROM: Email address to send notifications from
   - EMAIL_PASSWORD: Email address password

## Usage

To run the application:

```bash
yarn build && yarn start
```

The application will check the status of the packages immediately upon starting, and then at the specified interval according to the TIMER environment variable.

## Email Notifications

The application supports email notifications to alert you when there are changes in the package statuses. To enable this feature, make sure to configure the email service in the `mailService.ts` file. Replace the `sendEmail` function with your own implementation or integrate with an email service provider of your choice.
